# blokus_mcts



- Blokus implemented in Python
- MCTS implemented in Python

Used to work on this a while ago. The code is hard to read and I haven't refactored it yet. Python was too slow and didn't support multithreading, so I made a switch to C++. The current repository that I'm working on is [AlphaZero](<https://github.com/SPark9625/AlphaZero>).



I might refactor this later once I finish this project in C++ to keep it as a Python reference.
